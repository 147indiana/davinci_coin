About Davinci
Since 1996, the Korean wave known as ‘hallyu’ has become one of the largest contents in China, and this content has achieved great success in overseas markets. However, as a result of the North Korean nuclear issue in 2016, the United States’ Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) missile defense system was installed in South Korea. Due to the THAAD system, tensions between South Korea and China rose, which has adversely affected the Korean wave.

 
According to trade statistics in 2017, Korea’s trade with China accounted for more than 20% of the total trade volume (exports 24.8%, imports 20.5%). Korea was ranked highest for both the export and import sectors. China imported 9.9% of its total trade volume from South Korea, edging out Japan, and recorded fourth with 4.3% in all export sectors.

 

Nowadays, this full-scale trade between South Korea and China has significantly slowed down compared with what it was before 2017. Unexpected diplomatic issues have negatively affected the cultural exchanges between the two countries. However, the people have raised their voice in hopes to resolve the issues between South Korea and China in the private sector, rather than on the diplomatic level. People have decided to join forces to find answers through cultural ideas as a way to transcend the diplomatic barrier. The Davinci Project began with the aim of promoting the private interchange between South Korea and China through South Korea’s block chain skill as an IT powerhouse.
